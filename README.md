This is my private repository to learn microservice in Go without frameworks (go packages like httprouter and cors are still included)

## Helpful Non Vanilla Packages
### General
- cors          (CORS settings)
- httprouter    (Better routing alternative to vanilla net/http's one file per Handler)
- gotenv        (Useful for global variables using .env file)
- logrus        (Good for logging middleware)

### DB
- lib/pq        (Postgresql Driver. This is required by the database/sql for connection)
